Linear’s long term DeFi vision is to increase inclusiveness and democratize access to investment assets (digital and traditional). Tremendous value exists in the ability for investors to easily and quickly invest, save fees, and secure assets at fair market value. Linear combines substantial technical experience from numerous crypto projects with extensive financial experience in exotic and structured assets from traditional global asset management firms to bring to market one of the first DeFi projects built upon Ethereum with cross-chain compatibility. Linear will allow users to build and manage spot or portfolio exposures with a slew of innovative digital and traditional financial products. Linear is backed by our Ethereum-based Linear Token (LINA) with synthetic assets built on other EVM compatible chains first and other prominent blockchains in the long run, making the staking, investing, and redemption process easier, quicker and with substantially lower transaction fees whilst maintaining access to the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.\n\nLinear is a non-custodial cross-chain compatible DeFi protocol with unlimited liquidity and serves in the creation of synthetic assets (Liquids) with zero slippage. The backbone to Linear’s protocol is our collateralized debt pool, backed by our Linear token (LINA), and eventually other digital and real world assets. Users who have provided collateralized assets to the debt pool are able to “build” Linear USD (lUSD) which can then be used to purchase synthetic assets (Liquids) on our exchange. The collateralized assets are subsequently pooled to enable instantaneous liquidity and serve as a counterparty. LINA will also be a governance token enabling holders to vote on distribution models, assets to be listed, oracle selection, pledge ratio etc. LINA holders within the debt pool will obtain pro-rata fees from the building of Liquids.\n\nThe LINA token will adopt an inflationary model to enhance staking incentives and will have liquidity mining programs to encourage usage of the exchange and stability of the pool. Synthetization of assets will focus on cryptocurrencies, commodities and, more importantly, traditional assets such as market indices and thematic theme exposures.\n\nThe long term vision of Linear is to provide a platform for any user to gain exposure to a wide range of assets without slippage and settlement time. Furthermore, Linear Finance will act as a reliable gateway with the adoption of cryptocurrency we saw in 2020 and the collaboration of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Centralized Finance (CeFi). Applications can be developed on top of Linear for CeFi / DeFi composability.","Security Information":""  },

Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (“BTCST”) solves this problem by bringing exchange-grade liquidity to Bitcoin mining. Each BTCST is collateralized by a fixed amount of Bitcoin mining power. By staking BTCSTs, holders of the tokens will receive daily Bitcoin distributions that correspond to the mining power staked. And because the market price of BTCST is determinable as the discounted cashflow of the underlying mining power, BTCST in secondary trading will perform as a leveraged Bitcoin token free from liquidation risk. BTCST will create an efficient market for Bitcoin’s mining power in ways similar to how Grayscale Bitcoin Trust creates institutional liquidity for Bitcoin. To reduce user experience frictions in DeFi, BTCST is issued and operates on top of Binance Smart Chain.","Detailed Project Description":"Unlike nearly all other virtual assets, BTCST is a collateral-backed asset. Standard Hashrate Group, the community organizers, pioneered issuing hashrate-backed assets - in this case Bitcoin - directly onto a DeFi platform. And as a result, BTCST provides the market with premium collateral to further expand the DeFi ecosystem. Since its launch in early January, the community-led project has also enabled its holders to participate in the governance process such as voting on upgrades to the dapp itself. The BTCST dapp was deployed onto Binance Smart Chain because it provides a low-cost user experience without sacrificing transparency that miners demand. The dapp uses Binance BTC (BTCB) to regularly distribute profits so that even small amounts of BTC can be easily withdrawn which is not possible with the native Bitcoin chain. Standard Hashrate Group is intended to be an open association, where we, together, provide a service to all eligible miners to tokenize their hash rate. Our goal is to be the Grayscale Trust for Bitcoin mining hash rate. In a few years, we aim to be working with all the major miners and mining facilities around the world, so we can bring meaningful liquidity to anyone - including DeFi holders - who want exposure to this rapidly growing industry.  In short, BTCST aims to bridge the Bitcoin mining world to the DeFi world.","Security Information":"Certik: https://www.btcst.finance/static/Certik_Final_Report_for_BTCST.pdf"  },

It achieves a lower gas fee without using layer2 and ensures composability.\n\n2 Single pool supporting multiple stablecoins with better liquidity\nUnlike Curve, which supports up to 4 stablecoins in one pool, Smoothy can support multiple stablecoins in one single pool, and can flexibly add/remove any token. Theoretically, Smoothy can accommodate hundreds of different types of stablecoins in one pool (even algorithm stablecoin). This means that Smoothy will not suffer from the fragmented liquidity of multiple pools, enabling better liquidity.\n\n3 Maximum LP reward\nWith reference to the bank’s reserve system, we designed a unique Dynamic Cash Reserve Algorithm, which dynamically allocates the majority of funds in the underlying interest-earning platform and the rest is reserved to meet daily swap needs. In other words, in addition to governance token earnings, liquidity providers can gain swap fees together with interest earning and lower gas fee.\n\n4 Zero-slippage swapping algorithm\nSmoothy develops a SmoothSwap algorithm that can guarantee 1:1 ratio swap most of the time if the percentage of the token in the pool is lower than soft weights; if not, a swap is still allowed by imposing a penalty fee as slippage.","Security Information":"PeckShield: https://smoothy.finance/PeckShield-Audit-SmoothyV1-v1.0rc.pdf"  },

The platform also provides ‘cross-chain’ swaps to conduct exchange settlements without regard to the limitations of a typical isolated Blockchain network.  The term ‘cross-chain’ derives itself from the fact that the exchange is executed after traveling across two or more separate blockchain networks.

While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their  own parameters such as borrow/supply interest rate, liquidation threshold, Loan-to-Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA offers a  flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA also offers the credit score function based on  financial data on-chain analysis as a useful tool that reduces risk and increases profits for all users. ","Detailed Project Description":"TRAVA.FINANCE (or TRAVA) is the world’s first decentralized marketplace for cross-chain lending. While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrowing/lending interest rate, liquidity threshold, Loan to Value ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA.FINANCE offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business. TRAVA.FINANCE is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain and allows for lending with BSC tokens first; we then enable cross-chain lending with various tokens on Ethereum and other blockchain networks.\n\nThe pool owners, who are an additional role to lenders and borrowers, can receive more earnings by devising a good lending strategy for their pools. Moreover, to reduce risks and stimulate lending and borrowing, TRAVA.FINANCE performs cross-chain data analysis on multiple blockchain networks to (i) recommend optimal pool parameters for pool owners and (ii) detect unusual transactions in their pools. The lending marketplace model of TRAVA.FINANCE will increase crypto liquidity and promote the growth of the DeFi ecosystem. There are six salient features of TRAVA.FINANCE, including:\n\nCrypto lending marketplace: TRAVA.FINANCE creates a marketplace in which anyone confident in their abundant capital and profound knowledge of finance is free to create and manage their own lending pools. This multiple-pool model allows pool owners and their pool members to flexibly adapt their investment strategies to the volatility of the crypto market and obtain greater earnings.\n\nSemantic knowledge graph: TRAVA.FINANCE is built upon the semantic cross-chain knowledge graph. The graph is a distributed ledger that holds the data collected from multiple blockchain networks in the form of entities and their interconnections. The graph allows TRAVA.FINANCE to efficiently search for useful information such as (i) the amount and value of assets exchanged between two wallet addresses; (ii) the provenance of an NFT; (iii) aggregated assets of the same user on multiple networks, etc.\n\nData analysis: To reduce lending risks, TRAVA.FINANCE performs statistical data analysis based on the cross-chain knowledge graph and other data sources. TRAVA.FINANCE recommends the optimal parameters for pool owners to create and maintain their own pools (e.g., borrowing-lending interest rate, Loan to Value ratio, liquidation threshold, a minimum credit score of borrowers). TRAVA.FINANCE also assists them in detecting and alerting unusual transactions in their pools.\n\nCredit score evaluation: Though being an effective tool in lending, credit score has never been used in existing decentralized lending platforms. As a pioneer, TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to evaluate credit scores for users and their digital assets. The pool owners thus can (i) reduce the lending risks by defining a credit-score threshold for borrowers participating in the lending pool; and (ii) stimulate borrowing by defining a high Loan to Value ratio for borrowers with high credit scores.\n\nCross-chain identification and cross-chain lending: TRAVA.FINANCE uses the cross-chain identification protocol to identify all wallet addresses of the same users on different networks. After that, users can use up all of their cryptos as collateral for a huge loan in a single transaction. This facilitates their borrowing operations and saves them transaction fees. Cross- chain identification also helps them to increase their credit scores.\n\nNFT, stock tokens, and other digital assets as collaterals: To increase the liquidity of such special assets as NFT, stock tokens, or smart contracts, TRAVA.FINANCE allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn considerable amounts from the contract.","Security Information":"Certik: https://www.certik.org/projects/trava"  },

By staking gold you will be able to attract and hire your first creatures.\n\nWar Gold (Wgold)\n\nThe wGOLD is the core token of APWars. Through it liquidity is channeled to all other tokens. With wGOLD you can foster loyal troops or hire mercenaries.\n\nBattles\n\nThe war between the two factions \"Corporation\" and the \"Degenerates\" is a bloody combat from which only one winner can emerge. Factions clash their powers against one-another, where confrontation can result in causalities from both sides, and the winner faction is announced. The faction won the war will have the opportunity to prove their worth once more by challenging the Forces of Extreme Darkness and earning treasures. They will have the chance to earn great wealth in tokens that are securely guarded by the dragon Louis.\n\nLegendary Relics (NFTs)\n\nEpic battles generate passion, faith and fear. All those energies are materialized in legendary relics in form of Non Fungible Tokens.\n\nMuch More!\n\nWe will release a new roadmap to the next 6 months.
