Linear’s long term DeFi vision is to increase inclusiveness and democratize access to investment assets (digital and traditional). Tremendous value exists in the ability for investors to easily and quickly invest, save fees, and secure assets at fair market value. Linear combines substantial technical experience from numerous crypto projects with extensive financial experience in exotic and structured assets from traditional global asset management firms to bring to market one of the first DeFi projects built upon Ethereum with cross-chain compatibility. Linear will allow users to build and manage spot or portfolio exposures with a slew of innovative digital and traditional financial products. Linear is backed by our Ethereum-based Linear Token (LINA) with synthetic assets built on other EVM compatible chains first and other prominent blockchains in the long run, making the staking, investing, and redemption process easier, quicker and with substantially lower transaction fees whilst maintaining access to the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.\n\nLinear is a non-custodial cross-chain compatible DeFi protocol with unlimited liquidity and serves in the creation of synthetic assets (Liquids) with zero slippage. The backbone to Linear’s protocol is our collateralized debt pool, backed by our Linear token (LINA), and eventually other digital and real world assets. Users who have provided collateralized assets to the debt pool are able to “build” Linear USD (lUSD) which can then be used to purchase synthetic assets (Liquids) on our exchange. The collateralized assets are subsequently pooled to enable instantaneous liquidity and serve as a counterparty. LINA will also be a governance token enabling holders to vote on distribution models, assets to be listed, oracle selection, pledge ratio etc. LINA holders within the debt pool will obtain pro-rata fees from the building of Liquids.\n\nThe LINA token will adopt an inflationary model to enhance staking incentives and will have liquidity mining programs to encourage usage of the exchange and stability of the pool. Synthetization of assets will focus on cryptocurrencies, commodities and, more importantly, traditional assets such as market indices and thematic theme exposures.\n\nThe long term vision of Linear is to provide a platform for any user to gain exposure to a wide range of assets without slippage and settlement time. Furthermore, Linear Finance will act as a reliable gateway with the adoption of cryptocurrency we saw in 2020 and the collaboration of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Centralized Finance (CeFi). Applications can be developed on top of Linear for CeFi / DeFi composability.","Security Information":""  },

Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (“BTCST”) solves this problem by bringing exchange-grade liquidity to Bitcoin mining. Each BTCST is collateralized by a fixed amount of Bitcoin mining power. By staking BTCSTs, holders of the tokens will receive daily Bitcoin distributions that correspond to the mining power staked. And because the market price of BTCST is determinable as the discounted cashflow of the underlying mining power, BTCST in secondary trading will perform as a leveraged Bitcoin token free from liquidation risk. BTCST will create an efficient market for Bitcoin’s mining power in ways similar to how Grayscale Bitcoin Trust creates institutional liquidity for Bitcoin. To reduce user experience frictions in DeFi, BTCST is issued and operates on top of Binance Smart Chain.","Detailed Project Description":"Unlike nearly all other virtual assets, BTCST is a collateral-backed asset. Standard Hashrate Group, the community organizers, pioneered issuing hashrate-backed assets - in this case Bitcoin - directly onto a DeFi platform. And as a result, BTCST provides the market with premium collateral to further expand the DeFi ecosystem. Since its launch in early January, the community-led project has also enabled its holders to participate in the governance process such as voting on upgrades to the dapp itself. The BTCST dapp was deployed onto Binance Smart Chain because it provides a low-cost user experience without sacrificing transparency that miners demand. The dapp uses Binance BTC (BTCB) to regularly distribute profits so that even small amounts of BTC can be easily withdrawn which is not possible with the native Bitcoin chain. Standard Hashrate Group is intended to be an open association, where we, together, provide a service to all eligible miners to tokenize their hash rate. Our goal is to be the Grayscale Trust for Bitcoin mining hash rate. In a few years, we aim to be working with all the major miners and mining facilities around the world, so we can bring meaningful liquidity to anyone - including DeFi holders - who want exposure to this rapidly growing industry.  In short, BTCST aims to bridge the Bitcoin mining world to the DeFi world.","Security Information":"Certik: https://www.btcst.finance/static/Certik_Final_Report_for_BTCST.pdf"  },

BiFi aims to create a multichain DeFi ecosystem for  cryptocurrencies with financial products and services that interoperate across multiple blockchains with scalable efficiency.\n\nIn its first iteration, BiFi offers lending and staking protocols. The lending protocol implements depositing and borrowing, and the staking protocol implements liquidity pools, which will serve as the foundation for the upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX). The interest rates on BiFi Lending is algorithmically derived from the supply and demand in the market. This decentralized lending enables investors to take leveraged long positions, short a token, and earn interest on idle assets. To attract liquidity and ensure stability, BiFi distributes governance tokens ($BiFi) as incentives to the initial users, who eventually become the stakeholders and administrators of the protocol.\n\nIn the current stage, BiFi is available on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum Mainnet. Unlike other DeFi projects, BiFi on BSC and Ethereum are not separate instances, living on seprate islands. BiFi’s smart contracts based on Bifrost transfers real-time market data on both chains to distribute BiFi tokens to users of both blockchains.\nIn later stages, it will connect these protocols to other blockchains that fully support smart contracts, such as Tron, Polkadot, and Klaytn, and ultimately blockchains that do not, like Bitcoin.\n\nTo support multichain interactions, BiFi also provides its own proprietary multichain wallet that supports multichain DeFi services on BiFi as well as essential P2P payments functions. Ultimately, when BiFi’s DeFi ecosystem is formed with multichain lending, multichain DEX, and multichain wallet, Bifrost’s multichain technology that drives BiFi will also be made available to others seeking to build multichain DeFi projects.\n","Security Information":"Theori: https://github.com/bifrost-platform/BIFI/blob/master/docs/bifrost_bifi_audit.pdf"  },

It achieves a lower gas fee without using layer2 and ensures composability.\n\n2 Single pool supporting multiple stablecoins with better liquidity\nUnlike Curve, which supports up to 4 stablecoins in one pool, Smoothy can support multiple stablecoins in one single pool, and can flexibly add/remove any token. Theoretically, Smoothy can accommodate hundreds of different types of stablecoins in one pool (even algorithm stablecoin). This means that Smoothy will not suffer from the fragmented liquidity of multiple pools, enabling better liquidity.\n\n3 Maximum LP reward\nWith reference to the bank’s reserve system, we designed a unique Dynamic Cash Reserve Algorithm, which dynamically allocates the majority of funds in the underlying interest-earning platform and the rest is reserved to meet daily swap needs. In other words, in addition to governance token earnings, liquidity providers can gain swap fees together with interest earning and lower gas fee.\n\n4 Zero-slippage swapping algorithm\nSmoothy develops a SmoothSwap algorithm that can guarantee 1:1 ratio swap most of the time if the percentage of the token in the pool is lower than soft weights; if not, a swap is still allowed by imposing a penalty fee as slippage.","Security Information":"PeckShield: https://smoothy.finance/PeckShield-Audit-SmoothyV1-v1.0rc.pdf"  },

At its core, Unagi charges a 10% transaction fee and re-distributes that fee to existing Unagi holders instantly and automatically at the time of each transaction. Unique features of the Unagi token smart contract allow certain addresses like the PancakeSwap pool or exchange wallets to be blocked from earning fees. Because of this, 100% of the fees generated go to holders of the token. The percentage of fees you earn is calculated by the percentage of $UNAGI that you own among holders. This generates a much higher yield than would otherwise be possible. There is no team or central party that has to award the fees. There is no interface to claim the fees. No action needs to be taken on your part other than to hold $UNAGI in a wallet you control. 6 main features of $UNAGI are as follow: 1. $UNAGI is build and tested on Binance Smart Chain working as BEP-20 token. 2. $UNAGI is 100% community-based project as no pre-sale and all token supply are added into PancakeSwap V2 liquidity. 3. $UNAGI implemented with Anti-Pump-Dump methodology to reduce the possible of whales controlling the bull and bear of the market. 4. $UNAGI Dev’s team will spend 2 BNB to perform LP token locked on UniCrypt for 5 years. 5.
